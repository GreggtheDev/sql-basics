-- Reflection
-- In this assignment, I learned how to create and manipulate a SQLite database using SQL queries. 
-- It was interesting to see how data can be structured and managed efficiently. 
-- One challenge I faced was ensuring the correct syntax for each SQL command, especially when updating and deleting records. 
-- Another challenge was figuring out the correct steps to take since the ones provided were outdated.
-- This exercise helped reinforce my understanding of database operations and their importance in software development.
